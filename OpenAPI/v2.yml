    **This documentation pertains to the beta release of API v2.**


    **We aim to provide clear and comprehensive information, yet we invite your
    feedback to further refine the documentation. We welcome any suggestions for
    improvement, bug reports, or additional comments to enhance the overall
    utility and accuracy.**


    **Please note that as this is a beta version, some endpoints are subject to
    potential changes. We will promptly document all modifications in this
    section and include them in our release notes.**


    ---


    This is the Exivity API specification, and should be used as a reference
    guide for creating requests and parsing responses. For a more general
    introduction to Exivity, please refer to our [documentation](https://).


    Download latest [Postman collection](https://) from our [GitHub
    repository](https://).


    # Overview


    1. This API uses principles and constraints of [REST APIs](https://).

    2. You need a valid API token for requests.

    3. The API has rate limiting.

    4. Most resource endpoints listen to and responds with data structures as
    defined by the [JSON:API standard](https://). You'll recognise these
    endpoints when the documentation lists the following headers:
        

    ```

    Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

    Accept: application/vnd.api+json

     ```

    # Authentication


    The default method of authentication against the API is done through a
    stateless [JWT token](https://).


    It is also possible to authenticate the API via LDAP or SAML, if your
    administrator has set up access to either of these systems.


    #### **How to use the token**


    The default method of authentication against the API is done through a
    stateless [JWT token](https://), sent along as an Authentication header. To
    obtain a token, a request to the API endpoint `/v1/auth/token` should be
    made with the user credentials.


    Once a token has been generated, please include it in the headers of other
    requests to allow authorization.


    _Example:_


    ```

    Authorization: Bearer [token]

     ```

    The JWT token will expire after _4 hours_ for security reasons. This value
    is configurable. Please see [/configuration](https://) or
    [https://docs.exivity.com/architecture%20concepts/glossary/#authentication-token](https://docs.exivity.com/architecture%20concepts/glossary/#authentication-token)
    for more information.


    # The Resource Object


    Each section of the API Reference contains an object, detailing the
    different attributes the endpoint accepts.


    _Example:_


    | **attribute** | **type** | **mutability** | **description** |

    | --- | --- | --- | --- |

    | name | _string_ | 📝 editable | Required, unique name for service
    category. Max 255 chars. |


    ## Types


    The follow types appear in this document:


    - `integer`

    - `float`

    - `double`

    - `string`

    - `array`

    - `enum`\- this will be followed by an array of possible values. e.g
    _enum_(`charge`,`quantity`)

    - `date`

    - `datetime`

    - `time`
        

    Date, datetime and time follow the ISO 8601 standard


    - `Y` - A full numeric representation of a year, 4 digits e.g, `1996`,
    `2021`

    - `m` - Numeric representation of a month, with leading zeros e.g. `01`
    through `12`

    - `d` - Day of the month, 2 digits with leading zeros e.g. `01` to `31`

    - `H` - 24-hour format of an hour with leading zeros e.g. `00` to `23`

    - `i` - Minutes with leading zeros e.g. `00` to `59`

    - `s` - Seconds with leading zeros e.g. `00` to `59`

    - `Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z` - ISO 8601 datetime e.g. `2022-05-17T13:35:25Z`
        

    _Examples:_


    - Y-m = `2017-01`
        

    ### Nullable values


    Nullable values will have a question mark listed after the type. Examples:
    `integer?`, `string?`


    ## Mutability


    This column states whether a value is changable.


    - 📝 editable - These values can be changed

    - 🔏 immutable - Once set, these values cannot be changed

    - 👁 read-only - This values are set internal by the system and the user
    cannot change them
        

    ## Relationships


    It is possible to include related relationships with a give resource request
    (see Working with the API -> Include Related Resources for how to do this).
    The possible relationships are listed under the resource object.


    Example:


    | **relationship** | **type** | **required** |

    | --- | --- | --- |

    | hasOne | adjustments | ✔️ |

    | hasMany | services | ❌ |

    | hasOne | usergroup | ❌ |


    ### Required


    Some resources require a relationship to be created e.g. creating a new user
    required a usergroup. Any required relationships will be give in the **Add**
    example of the resource.


    # Working with the API


    ## Placeholders


    Different variables have double curly brackets around them (`{{`, `}}`).
    These used for placeholders in this documentation. When working with the
    API, these placeholders should be replaced with real values. Examples
    include:


    `{{base_url}}` - replace this with your API's url


    `{{workflow_id}}`, `{{report_id}}`, `{{account_id}}`, etc - these are
    placeholders for a specific ID for an object.


    ## Query String Parameters


    Some requests using the JSON:API format accept additional query string
    parameters.


    ### Filtering


    To filter results, use the `filter[attribute]` query string parameter.


    The following formats are supported for filtering results:


    | Token | Description | Example |

    | --- | --- | --- |

    | `^` | Field starts with | `filter[name]=^John` |

    | `$` | Field ends with | `filter[name]=$Smith` |

    | `~` | Field contains | `filter[favorite_cheese]=~cheddar` |

    | `<` | Field is less than | `filter[lifetime_value]=<50` |

    | `>` | Field is greater than | `filter[lifetime_value]=>50` |

    | `>=` | Field is greater than or equals | `filter[lifetime_value]=>=50` |

    | `<=` | Field is less than or equals | `filter[lifetime_value]=<=50` |

    | `=` | Field is equal to | `filter[username]==Specific Username` |

    | `!=` | Field is not equal to | `filter[username]=!=common username` |

    | `[...]` | Field is one or more of | `filter[id]=[1,5,10]` |

    | `![...]` | Field is not one of | `filter[id]=![1,5,10]` |

    | `{...,...}` | Between exclusive (e.g. 2 up to 99) | `filter[id]={1,100}` |

    | `={...,...}` | Between inclusive (e.g. 1 up to 100) |
    `filter[id]=={1,100}` |

    | `NULL` | Field is null | `filter[address]=NULL` |

    | `NOT_NULL` | Field is not null | `filter[email]=NOT_NULL` |


    _Example - get accounts that start with W:_


    ```

    GET /accounts?filter[name]=^W

     ```

    #### Multiple filters


    The filter parameter can occur multiple times in a request to filter by
    multiple fields.


    _Example - get accounts that start with W and level is set to one:_


    ```

    GET /accounts?filter[name]=^W&filter[level]==1

     ```

    #### Related entities filters


    A filter can also use related entities (which don't have to be included in
    the request with the `include` parameter).


    _Example - get users with MANAGE_USERS permission, and an email address
    ending with "example.com":_


    ```

    GET
    /user?filter[usergroup.permissions]=~MANAGE_USERS&filter[email_address]=$example.com

     ```

    ### Pagination


    When making requests to endpoints which can return more than one entity,
    results are paginated. The number of results per page and the requested page
    can be adjusted with the `page[limit]` and `page[offset]` query string
    parameters.


    _Example:_


    ```

    GET /user?page[limit]=50&page[offset]=2

     ```

    When the page limit is set to `-1`, all results are returned.


    The `links` element in the JSON response contains references to URLs which
    can be used to navigate the resultset.


    The `meta` element in the JSON response contains a reference to the total
    number of items in the resultset.


    ### Sorting


    It is possible to sort results by using the `sort` query string parameter. A
    descending sort order can be requested by prefixing a hyphen (U+002D).


    _Example:_


    ```

    GET /user?sort=-username

     ```

    ### Include Related Resources


    Inclusion of related resources in the response can be requested with the
    `include` query string parameter. Multiple entities can be specified by
    separating them with a comma (U+002C). Each endpoint definition specifies
    which includes can be requested.


    _Examples:_


    ```

    GET /user?include=usergroup,accounts

    GET /user/[id]?include=usergroup,accounts

     ```

    ### Fetching relationships


    It is also possible to fetch relationship data to a single resource using a
    separate endpoint. Relationships data on resources can be
    [queried](https://) and [modified](https://) by using the
    `/[resource]/[id]/relationships/[relation]` endpoint structure.


    ```

    GET /user/[id]/usergroup

     ```

    # Atomic Operations


    Many endpoint support Atomic Operations. This provides a means to perform
    multiple “operations” in a linear and atomic manner.


    At the top of all endpoints, it states whether or not it supports atomic
    operations:


    - Atomic support: ✔️

    - Atomic support:❌
        

    Please read the [JSON:API Atomic
    Operations](https://jsonapi.org/ext/atomic/) documentation to understand how
    this works.


    **Example**


    Add a workflow and a workflow step in a single request:


    ``` json

    {
        "atomic:operations": [
            {
                "op": "add",
                "data": {
                    "type": "workflow",
                    "lid": "foo",
                    "attributes": {
                        "name": "Atomic workflow",
                        "description": "My new atomic workflow"
                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "op": "add",
                "data": {
                    "type": "workflowstep",
                    "lid": "bar",
                    "attributes": {
                        "type": "execute",
                        "timeout": 600,
                        "options": {
                            "command": "echo \"testing\""
                        }
                    },
                    "relationships": {
                        "workflow": {
                            "data": {
                                "type": "workflow",
                                "lid": "foo"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }

     ```

    All atomic request must be submitted throught the atomic endpoint:


    `POST {{base_url}}/v2/`


    See [General/Json API atomic
    operation](#d00d58da-6562-45db-bcb1-917dd57e6fb5) for more examples.


    # Error responses


    Errors are returned as a JSON object, following the [JSON:API error
    standard](https://). We use HTTP error responses in the status field, to
    indicate whether the request was a success (`2xx`) or a failure(`4xx`,
    `5xx`).


    _Example:_


    ``` json

    {
      "errors": [
        {
          "status": "422",
          "title":  "Attribute validation error",
          "detail": "Password must contain at least 8 characters."
        }
      ]
    }

     ```

    Possible response codes:


    | Code | Description |

    | --- | --- |

    | `400 Bad request` | Something in the request is missing or invalid |

    | `401 Unauthorized` | JWT token is missing or invalid |

    | `403 Forbidden` | Missing required permission for this operation |

    | `404 Not found` | Entity can't be found |

    | `409 Conflict` | Entity type or id doesn't match endpoint |

    | `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Parameters validation error |

    | `503 Service Unavailable` | Rate lime exceeded |


    ## Authentication error response


    If an authorization token is missing, expired or malformed, an error
    response will be returned. These errors will always have a `401
    Unauthorised` status.


    _Example:_


    ``` json

    {
        "errors": [
            {
                "status": 401,
                "title": "AuthException",
                "detail": "Invalid token provided, please login again."
            }
        ]
    }

     ```

    ## Authorization error response


    Some endpoints require a different set of permissions than others. If
    insufficient permissions are granted to the authenticated user, a `403
    Forbidden` response is returned.


    # Rate limits


    All API requests are rate limited to avoid overloading the server.  

    The rate at which you can make requests to the API is limited by client IP
    address, and is limited at 10 requests per second. The API allows for short
    request bursts (i.e. you can exceed this limit for a short period of time).
    If you've exceeded your API rate limit, you'll get back a `503 Service
    Unavailable` response.


    Requests containing a user password in the payload are even further rate
    limited to mitigate brute-force attacks in user credentials.

      ### Charge and cogs type


      The attributes `charge_type` and `cogs_type` define how the rate is used
      when calculating charge and cogs metrics using consumption of the service.


      - The first part denotes whether the rate is dynamically derived from the
      usage data itself (`automatic`) or specified explicitly in rate entities
      (`manual`).

      - The second part denotes whether an amount per unit of consumption
      (`per_unit`) and/or per interval (`per_interval`) should be applied.
          

      When the second part is omitted, both `per_unit` and `per_interval` are
      used. If no rate should be applied at all, `none` can be used. A value of
      `other` means a configuration is used not currently supported by the API.

      in all other environments and can be overridden in each environment.

        A simple test to check the system is set up correctly. If all is well,
        this request should return a simple HTML page with a link to the API
        documentation.


        It is also possible to ask for a JSON response, using the `Accept:
        application/json` header.


        This will return a 204 response if all is good, or a 500 error with a
        JSON error message if something is not correct.


        In debug mode, this will also contain a `meta` field, listing the area
        where the problem is.

      summary: JSON API atomic operation
      description: >-
        Many endpoint support Atomic Operations. This provides a means to
        perform multiple “operations” in a linear and atomic manner.


        At the top of all endpoints, it states whether or not it supports atomic
        operations.


        Example: Atomic support: ✔️


        Please read the [JSON:API Atomic
        Operations](https://jsonapi.org/ext/atomic/) documentation and see the
        examples to understand how this works.

        The preparation of a report populates the accounts table and also
        optimizes the performance when running your reports. When adjustments
        change, it is a good idea to run this command to update any effected
        data.
